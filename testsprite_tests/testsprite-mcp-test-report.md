### Failure Analysis

**Common Error:** "Test execution timed out after 15 minutes"

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Network Connectivity**: TestSprite proxy tunnel may have connectivity issues
2. **Application Startup**: Local development server (port 3000) may require longer initialization
3. **Test Environment**: Testing infrastructure may need optimization for complex React applications
