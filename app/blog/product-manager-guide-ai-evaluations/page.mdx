# The Product Manager's Guide to AI Evaluations: Building Better AI Products

As generative AI becomes a core part of modern products, product managers face a new challenge: **How do you evaluate and improve systems that produce different outputs for the same input?** Traditional software testing falls short when dealing with the non-deterministic nature of AI. Enter **AI evaluations (evals)**—a systematic approach that's now essential for every product manager working with AI.

## Why AI Evals Matter More Than Ever

Top AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic now test AI evaluation skills in interviews. Why? Because building successful AI products isn't just about integrating powerful models—it's about **measuring, assessing, and continuously improving AI system performance** across multiple dimensions.

Unlike traditional software, generative AI systems are inherently non-deterministic. For example, a customer service chatbot might handle the same complaint differently each time, or an image generator might create vastly different results from identical prompts. This variability is a feature, not a bug, but it means conventional unit testing is no longer enough.

## Beyond Accuracy: The Multi-Dimensional Challenge

Evaluating AI systems means assessing performance across several dimensions at once. For a customer support bot, you might need to evaluate:

- **Accuracy:** Does it correctly address the customer's issue?
- **Tone:** Is the response empathetic and professional?
- **Completeness:** Does it provide all necessary information?
- **Safety:** Does it avoid harmful or inappropriate responses?

A response might be factually accurate but tone-deaf, or emotionally appropriate but incomplete. Effective AI evaluation must capture these nuances.

## The Four Pillars of Effective AI Evaluation

### 1. Creating Golden Standards

The foundation of robust evaluation is creating "**goldens**"—carefully curated examples of perfect inputs and outputs. These should cover:

- **Core use cases:** The main functions your AI should handle flawlessly
- **Edge cases:** Unusual but legitimate scenarios
- **Failure modes:** How the system should handle inappropriate or impossible requests

Creating goldens requires collaboration between product managers, engineers, designers, and domain experts. The upfront investment is significant, but it pays off by providing a stable foundation for all evaluation activities.

### 2. Scaling Through Synthetic Data

Manually creating thousands of test cases isn't practical. **Synthetic data generation**—using LLMs to generate additional test scenarios from goldens—offers:

- **Scale:** Thousands of test cases from a small set of goldens
- **Diversity:** Variations in phrasing, context, and edge cases
- **Privacy:** No need for real user data
- **Adversarial testing:** Challenging scenarios to stress-test your system

The key is ensuring synthetic data maintains quality and reflects real-world usage.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Grading

Automation is essential for scale, but **human judgment** is crucial for establishing ground truth. Team members should evaluate AI outputs against predefined criteria, creating a dataset of human-graded examples.

- Use clear rubrics for subjective dimensions (like tone or creativity)
- Use binary pass/fail for objective criteria, and scaled ratings (1-5) for nuanced assessments
- Disagreements between graders often reveal areas needing clarification

### 4. Automated Evaluation at Scale

Build "**auto-raters**"—AI systems that evaluate your main AI's outputs using goldens and human-graded datasets. Auto-raters:

- Dramatically reduce resource requirements for ongoing evaluation
- Enable rapid iteration and testing
- Should be validated to ensure high alignment (95%+) with human judgments
- Require regular spot-checking and continuous improvement

## Real-World Example: Bedtime Story Generator

Imagine building an AI-powered bedtime story generator for children. Your evaluation system might assess:

- **Story coherence:** Does the narrative flow logically?
- **Age appropriateness:** Is the content suitable?
- **Educational value:** Are learning elements included?
- **Engagement:** Is the story interesting?
- **Image alignment:** Do images match and enhance the story?

Each dimension would have goldens, synthetic data, human graders, and auto-raters to ensure quality.

## Building Evaluation Into Your Product Development Process

Effective AI evaluation is an **ongoing practice**:

- New features include evaluation criteria and test cases
- Performance metrics are tracked over time
- Evaluation results inform product decisions
- Standards are regularly reviewed and updated

## The Competitive Advantage of Systematic Evaluation

As AI becomes commoditized, the ability to systematically evaluate and improve AI systems is a key differentiator. Teams that master AI evaluation can:

- **Iterate faster:** Quick feedback loops enable rapid improvement
- **Scale quality:** Maintain high standards as systems grow
- **Build trust:** Demonstrate quality assurance to stakeholders
- **Reduce risk:** Identify and address issues before production

## Looking Forward

AI evaluation is now a core competency for product managers. As generative AI spreads across industries, the ability to systematically assess and improve these systems will distinguish successful teams.

**Start building these capabilities now, and you'll be well-positioned to lead successful AI product initiatives in the years ahead.**
