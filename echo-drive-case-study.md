# Streamlining Logistics: EchoDrive's Digital Breakthrough in Truckload Management

## Project Overview

**Client:** Echo Global Logistics, Inc.
**Partner:** Eight Bit Studios
**Timeline:** Alpha → Beta → Launch
**Platform:** iOS, Android, Web Application

Echo Global Logistics, headquartered in Chicago, is a prominent provider of technology-enabled transportation and supply chain management services. With over 30 offices nationwide, Echo specializes in offering comprehensive freight brokerage and Managed Transportation solutions across various modes, including truckload, partial truckload, LTL, intermodal, and expedited services. Utilizing a proprietary, web-based technology platform, Echo effectively compiles and analyzes data from its extensive network of over 40,000 transportation providers. This capability enables Echo to serve a diverse range of industries, streamlining the complex processes involved in transportation management.

## Overview

The shipping industry, reliant on outdated methods, faced challenges in coordinating between shippers, drivers, and dispatch teams. Echo and Eight Bit Studios embarked on building a modern shipment tracking system to improve communication and coordination.

## Ask

EchoDrive was envisioned to meet multiple key objectives in the logistics industry. The primary goals included achieving compliance with the Electronic Logging Device (ELD) Mandate through electronic logging, enhancing truckload visibility to reduce call-center stress, increasing Less Than Truckload (LTL) shipment revenues and volume via a self-serve booking application, and significantly boosting driver engagement as evidenced by beta downloads and active app users. The overarching aim was to drive year-over-year growth from the app's alpha phase to its beta release and eventual launch.

## Solution

Eight Bit Studios conducted in-depth user research, including on-site interviews with drivers and dispatch officers. They mapped a comprehensive journey, guiding the development of EchoDrive – a web-app for dispatch teams and a native mobile app for drivers. This system facilitated better communication and accurate shipment tracking, including features like:

- Login and Profiles
- Communication Platform with shipment tracker, job sharing, and issue reporting
- Interactive Onboarding Tutorials
- Invoice and Payment Tracking

## Results

The EchoDrive initiative achieved significant milestones, enhancing the efficiency and compliance of logistics operations. Key achievements include:

- Met ELD Mandate Compliance with electronic logging.
- Reduced call-center stress by improving truckload visibility.
- Increased LTL shipment revenues by 16% to $184.4 million from Q4 2019.
- Achieved a 12% increase in shipment volume, attributed to the self-serve booking application.
- Engaged drivers effectively, evidenced by 1,000 beta downloads and over 10,000 active drivers on the app.
- Demonstrated substantial year-over-year growth from the app's Alpha to Beta to Launch phases.
- Streamlined internal processes and bolstered driver-dispatcher communication, reinforcing Echo's digital strategy.
