# Serena MCP Server Integration

## Overview

Serena is a powerful coding agent toolkit that provides semantic code retrieval and editing capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enhances Claude Code's efficiency by offering IDE-like code navigation and symbol-level understanding.

## Installation Status

âœ… **Completed**: Serena MCP server has been added to Claude Code configuration

- Command: `claude mcp add serena -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena start-mcp-server --context ide-assistant --project $(pwd)`
- Context: `ide-assistant` (optimized for IDE integration)
- Project path: `/Users/MacBook/Developer/work.randyellis.design`

## Configuration Details

- **MCP Server**: Serena v0.1.4+
- **Context**: `ide-assistant` - Optimized for IDEs like VSCode, Cursor, or Cline
- **Project-specific**: Configured for the portfolio project only
- **Communication**: stdio transport protocol

## Expected Capabilities

### Semantic Code Analysis

- **Symbol-level understanding**: Find functions, classes, variables by name
- **Reference tracking**: Find where symbols are used across the codebase
- **Code structure analysis**: Get file overviews and symbol hierarchies
- **Precise editing**: Modify specific symbols without affecting surrounding code

### Portfolio-Specific Benefits

1. **React Component Navigation**
   - Quickly find component definitions and usages
   - Track prop interfaces and component relationships
   - Navigate between pages and client components

2. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Leverage LSP for type-aware code analysis
   - Find type definitions and interfaces
   - Track import/export relationships

3. **Project Architecture Understanding**
   - Map component hierarchies (ui/, case-study/, performance/)
   - Understand routing structure (/projects/, /blog/, etc.)
   - Track data flow and utility dependencies

### Key Tools Available

- `find_symbol`: Search for functions, components, types
- `find_referencing_symbols`: Find usages of symbols
- `get_symbols_overview`: Get file structure overview
- `insert_after_symbol`/`insert_before_symbol`: Precise code insertion
- `replace_symbol_body`: Replace entire function/component definitions
- `onboarding`: Automated project analysis and memory creation
- `write_memory`/`read_memory`: Project context persistence

## Usage Patterns

### Component Development

```bash
# Find a React component
find_symbol: "CometCardDemo"

# Find all components using a specific prop
find_referencing_symbols: "ProjectThumbnail"

# Get overview of a component file
get_symbols_overview: "components/ui/comet-card-demo.tsx"
```

### Code Refactoring

```bash
# Replace a component's implementation
replace_symbol_body: target specific function/component

# Add new props to existing component
insert_after_symbol: add to interface definitions

# Update import statements
find_referencing_symbols: track import usage
```

### Project Analysis

```bash
# Understand project structure
onboarding: automated analysis

# Save insights for later
write_memory: store architecture decisions

# Retrieve context
read_memory: load previous insights
```

## Project Structure Analysis

The portfolio project has a well-structured TypeScript/React architecture that Serena can effectively analyze:

### Key Directories

- `/app/` - Next.js app router pages and layouts
- `/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components and animations
- `/components/case-study/` - Project showcase components
- `/lib/` - Utilities, data, and configuration
- `/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `/__tests__/` - Comprehensive test suite

### Language Support

- **Primary**: TypeScript/JavaScript with React
- **Build**: Next.js framework
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Motion/Framer Motion
- **Testing**: Jest with Testing Library

## Best Practices

### When to Use Serena

1. **Complex Refactoring**: Multi-file component changes
2. **Architecture Analysis**: Understanding component relationships
3. **Debugging**: Tracing prop flow and dependencies
4. **Feature Development**: Adding components with proper integration

### Efficient Workflows

1. **Start with Overview**: Use `get_symbols_overview` before editing
2. **Use Memories**: Store project insights for faster future sessions
3. **Precise Targeting**: Use symbol-level tools instead of reading entire files
4. **Context Building**: Let Serena perform onboarding for new areas

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Server Not Loading**: Restart Claude Code after configuration changes
2. **Slow Performance**: Index the project with `serena project index`
3. **Missing Language Support**: Ensure TypeScript language server is available

### Verification Steps

1. Check for MCP tools prefixed with `mcp__serena__`
2. Use `initial_instructions` tool to load Serena's instructions
3. Run `activate_project` to ensure project is properly loaded

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Testing Integration

- Use shell execution to run tests after code changes
- Leverage project memories to understand test patterns
- Track test coverage across component modifications

### Performance Optimization

- Analyze component render patterns with symbol tracing
- Track prop drilling and state management
- Identify optimization opportunities through reference analysis

### Code Quality

- Maintain consistency across similar components
- Use existing patterns identified through project analysis
- Leverage type definitions for safer refactoring

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Contexts**: Create portfolio-specific Serena contexts
2. **Memory Templates**: Standardize project insight patterns
3. **Workflow Automation**: Custom scripts for common development tasks
4. **Integration Testing**: Automated validation of Serena tool usage
